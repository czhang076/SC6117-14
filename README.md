# Intelligent Knowledge Base with Auto-Clustering

Repository skeleton for the Capstone project: scalable search + auto-clustering for Markdown notes.

Structure (starter):

- `backend/` — FastAPI service scaffold
- `frontend/` — React/Next.js (placeholder)
- `services/` — specialized microservices (search, clustering, ingestion)
- `infra/` — docker-compose, infra helpers
- `docs/` — architecture, references
- `scripts/` — helper scripts (PowerShell)
- `data/` — raw and processed sample data
- `tests/` — test suites

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/REFERENCES.md` for design notes and references.
