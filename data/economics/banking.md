# 🏦 Banking Economics Notes

## 1. Role of Financial Intermediaries
* **Intermediation:** Connecting Surplus Units (Savers) with Deficit Units (Borrowers).
* **Maturity Transformation:** Banks borrow short-term (deposits) and lend long-term (mortgages/loans).
    * *Risk:* Creates inherent liquidity risk (Run on the Bank).
* **Money Creation:** Banks create money through fractional reserve banking.
    * **Money Multiplier:** $m = \frac{1}{Reserve\ Ratio}$.

## 2. Bank Management (Overlap with Finance)
* **The Bank Balance Sheet:**
    * **Assets:** Loans, Securities, Cash/Reserves.
    * **Liabilities:** Deposits (Checking/Savings), Wholesale Funding, Debt.
    * **Equity:** Capital cushion.
* **Asset-Liability Management (ALM):** Managing the mismatch between the duration of assets and liabilities to mitigate Interest Rate Risk.
* **Net Interest Margin (NIM):**
    $$NIM = \frac{\text{Interest Income} - \text{Interest Expense}}{\text{Average Earning Assets}}$$

## 3. Regulation & Capital Adequacy (Overlap with Risk Mgmt)
* **Rationale:** Banks are systemically important; failure causes contagion.
* **Basel Accords (Basel III):** Global regulatory framework.
    * **Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR):** Ensures banks hold enough capital to absorb losses.
    $$CAR = \frac{\text{Tier 1 Capital} + \text{Tier 2 Capital}}{\text{Risk Weighted Assets (RWA)}} \ge 8\%$$
    * **RWA:** Assets are weighted by riskiness (e.g., Cash = 0% risk, Corporate Loan = 100% risk).
* **Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR):** Banks must hold enough "High-Quality Liquid Assets" to survive a 30-day stress scenario.

## 4. Central Banking
* **Lender of Last Resort:** Providing liquidity to solvent but illiquid banks to prevent panic.
* **Transmission Mechanism:** How central bank policy rates pass through commercial banks to the real economy.
