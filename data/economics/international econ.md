# 🌍 International Economics Notes

## 1. International Trade Theory
* **Comparative Advantage (Ricardo):** Countries should specialize in producing goods where they have a lower *opportunity cost*, even if they have no absolute advantage.
* **Heckscher-Ohlin Model:** Countries export goods that use their abundant factors of production intensively (e.g., capital-rich countries export capital-intensive goods).
* **Trade Policy:**
    * **Tariffs:** Tax on imports. Raises domestic price, creates Deadweight Loss.
    * **Quotas:** Quantity limit on imports.

## 2. Balance of Payments (BoP)
Accounting record of all monetary transactions between a country and the rest of the world.
$$Current\ Account + Capital\ Account = 0$$
* **Current Account:** Trade in goods/services, income from assets, transfers.
* **Capital/Financial Account:** Trade in assets (stocks, bonds, FDI).

## 3. Open Economy Macroeconomics (Overlap with Macro)
* **Exchange Rates:**
    * **Nominal ($E$):** Price of one currency in terms of another.
    * **Real ($\epsilon$):** Relative price of goods. $\epsilon = \frac{E \times P_{domestic}}{P_{foreign}}$.
* **Mundell-Fleming Model (IS-LM-BoP):**
    * Extends IS-LM to an open economy by adding the **BP curve** (Balance of Payments equilibrium).
    * **The "Impossible Trinity":** A country cannot simultaneously have:
        1.  Fixed Exchange Rate
        2.  Free Capital Flow
        3.  Independent Monetary Policy
    * *Example:* If you fix exchange rates and allow capital flow, you lose control over interest rates.

## 4. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
* **Law of One Price:** Identical goods should sell for the same price in different countries when expressed in a common currency ($P = E \times P^*$).
