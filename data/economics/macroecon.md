# 📉 Macroeconomics Notes

## 1. Measuring the Economy
* **GDP (Gross Domestic Product):** Total market value of all final goods/services produced within a country.
    * *Expenditure Approach:* $Y = C + I + G + (X - M)$
* **Inflation:** Rate of change in price levels (CPI, PCE).
* **Unemployment:** The percentage of the labor force that is jobless and actively looking for work.
    * *Okun's Law:* Inverse relationship between unemployment and GDP growth.

## 2. Short-Run Fluctuations (The Business Cycle)
* **Aggregate Demand (AD):** Downward sloping (Wealth Effect, Interest Rate Effect, Exchange Rate Effect).
* **Aggregate Supply (AS):**
    * *Short-Run (SRAS):* Upward sloping (sticky wages/prices).
    * *Long-Run (LRAS):* Vertical at Potential Output (full employment).
* **IS-LM Model (Closed Economy):**
    * **IS Curve:** Goods market equilibrium ($Y = C + I + G$). Downward sloping.
    * **LM Curve:** Money market equilibrium ($M/P = L(Y, r)$). Upward sloping.
    * *Intersection:* Determines equilibrium interest rate ($r$) and output ($Y$).

## 3. Long-Run Growth
* **Solow Growth Model:**
    * Focuses on capital accumulation, labor force growth, and technological progress (Solow Residual).
    * **Steady State:** Investment = Depreciation. ($s f(k) = (\delta + n + g)k$).

## 4. Policy Tools
* **Fiscal Policy:** Govt spending ($G$) and Taxes ($T$). Affects IS curve.
* **Monetary Policy:** Central bank controls Money Supply ($M$). Affects LM curve.
* **Overlap Note:** In an open economy context, these policies are constrained by exchange rate regimes (see *International Economics*).
