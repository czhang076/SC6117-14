# Corporate Finance Notes

## 1. Core Principles
* **Goal of the Firm:** Maximize shareholder wealth (stock price).
* **Agency Problem:** Conflicts of interest between principals (shareholders) and agents (managers).
* **Capital Structure:** The mix of Debt ($D$) and Equity ($E$) used to finance operations.
    * **Modigliani-Miller Theorem:** In a perfect market (no taxes, bankruptcy costs), capital structure does not affect firm value.

## 2. Capital Budgeting
* **Net Present Value (NPV):** The sum of the present values of incoming and outgoing cash flows.
    * Rule: Accept if $NPV > 0$.
* **Internal Rate of Return (IRR):** The discount rate that makes $NPV = 0$.
    * Rule: Accept if $IRR >$ Cost of Capital.

## 3. Valuation: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
**Formula:**
$$V_0 = \sum_{t=1}^n \frac{FCF_t}{(1+WACC)^t} + \frac{TV}{(1+WACC)^n}$$

* **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Cash generated by the company after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain capital assets.
    * $FCF = \text{EBIT}(1 - \text{Tax Rate}) + \text{Depreciation} - \text{CapEx} - \Delta \text{Net Working Capital}$
* **WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital):**
    * The required return on the firm's assets, based on the market value of debt and equity.
* **Terminal Value (TV):**
    * Calculated using the **Perpetuity Growth Method** ($TV = \frac{FCF_n(1+g)}{r-g}$) or **Exit Multiple Method**.
