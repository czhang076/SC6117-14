# Private Equity Notes

## 1. Overview
* **Structure:** General Partners (GPs) manage the fund; Limited Partners (LPs) provide capital.
* **Strategy:** Buy companies, improve operations/financials, and sell at a profit (Exit).

## 2. Leveraged Buyout (LBO) Model
An acquisition where a significant portion of the purchase price is funded through debt.

### Key Drivers of Return
1.  **Deleveraging:** Using cash flow to pay down debt acts as equity value creation.
2.  **EBITDA Growth:** Operational improvements increase the numerator for exit valuation.
3.  **Multiple Expansion:** Selling at a higher EBITDA multiple than the entry multiple.

### LBO Modeling Steps 
1.  **Assumptions:** Entry Multiple, Debt/Equity ratio, Interest rates.
2.  **Sources & Uses:** Calculate total capital required and how it is funded.
3.  **Financial Projections:** Project Revenue $\rightarrow$ EBITDA $\rightarrow$ FCF.
4.  **Debt Schedule:** Waterfall mechanism to pay down Revolver, Term Loans, and Senior Notes.
5.  **Exit & Returns:** Calculate Equity Value at exit and derive **IRR** and **MOIC** (Multiple of Invested Capital).

## 3. PE-Specific DCF
* Used to determine the **Max Bid Price**.
* Unlike standard corporate finance DCF, PE often looks at **FCFE (Free Cash Flow to Equity)** or uses the target IRR (e.g., 20%+) as the discount rate to see what entry price makes the math work.
