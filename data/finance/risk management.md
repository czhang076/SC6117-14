# Risk Management Notes

## 1. Types of Risk

* **Market Risk:** Losses due to factors that affect the overall performance of the financial markets (recessions, interest rates).
* **Credit Risk:** Risk of default by a borrower (counterparty fails to pay).
* **Liquidity Risk:** Risk that an asset cannot be sold quickly without a substantial loss in value.
* **Operational Risk:** Risk of loss from failed internal processes, people, systems, or external events.

## 2. Measurement Tools

### For Market Risk
* **Value at Risk (VaR):**
    * A statistical metric estimating the **maximum potential loss** of a portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval.
    * *Example:* "We are 95% confident the loss won't exceed $1M tomorrow."

### For Credit Risk
* **Risk Weighted Assets (RWA):**
    * A metric used to determine the minimum amount of capital that must be held in relation to the risk profile of the lending activities.
    * **Mechanism:** Different assets are assigned different risk weights (e.g., Cash = 0%, Mortgage = 50%, Corporate Loan = 100%).
    * **Formula:** $RWA = \sum (\text{Exposure}_i \times \text{Risk Weight}_i)$

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
* **Hedging:** Using derivatives (Options, Futures, Swaps) to offset potential losses.
* **Diversification:** Spreading investments to reduce unsystematic risk.
